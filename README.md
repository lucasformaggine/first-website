# My First Website
Developing my first website using HTML5 and C55 in a local server

## Introduction

After the "Next Level Week", an initiative from Rocketseat Team to teach interested people how to program in front end, I've been developing a new project using CSS and HTML5. It's a local server website, using different concepts of HTML and
CSS, like:
  - icon
  - animation
  - display
  - box model
  - transitions
  - hyperlink references
  - containers
